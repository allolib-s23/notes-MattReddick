# Notes from Matt Reddick

##CMPSC 190D, Digital Synthesis 

###Piece Number One: 
* Original
* Creepy Noises
* https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-MattReddick
* To play the piece:
  - Clone the repo
  - Enter ./run.sh /tutorials/synthesis/04_FM.cpp
  - To play the song, use the drop down menu named "Event Sequencer", select "Creepy Noises", and hit play. 
* In this small piece, I was getting used to allolib and how to utilize different presets. I created this piece by modifying an output file rather than doing it programmatically. In this piece, I was attempting to make a somewhat unnerving tune, that could be used as some sort of theme song for a poorly made horror show intro. This piece operates on the 04_FM preset program. All in all, this piece is extremely lackluster but serves as a benchmark for my progress of pieces throughout the course. 


###Piece Number Two: 
* Transcription
* Intro inspired by  - (Fur by Endor) , rest of song inspired by - (Beethoven by Kenndog)
* https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-MattReddick
* To play the piece:
  - Clone the repo
  - Enter ./run.sh /tutorials/synthesis/beethovenRap.cpp
  - To play the song, press the "B" key
* In this song, I was attempting to combine two different songs that I enjoy very much personally, and integrate them into a small piece with beeats and instruments typical of that in a house song. All in all, while I was never fully happy with the sound profile I created for the beat, I got the chance to experiment with more immersive graphics. I took this piece as an oppurtunity to experiment with many overlayyed shapes, and created a graphical experience that is very intense and perhaps obnoxious. Enjoy! 


###Piece Number Three: 
* Original
* Untitled
* https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-MattReddick
* To play the piece:
  - Clone the repo
  - Enter ./run.sh /tutorials/synthesis/drumPlayground.cpp
  - To play the main song, press the "t" key
  - To play a small modified song, press the "r" key
  - To play another small modified song, press the "h" key
* In this piece, I was attempting to build my own chord progression and play that on top of different backbeats, house beats, and reggaeton beats. I made three different small pieces, with the longest and arguably best one being that activated by the "t" key. The chord progression is built upon a basic sine synth sound, and accompanied by the hihat, kick, and snares in the background. Overall, it feels very mediocre as a piece but is an example of likely my favorite original piece I made during the quarter. 


###Piece Number Four: 
* Transcription
* I"Golden Hour" by JVKE
* https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-MattReddick
* To play the piece:
  - Clone the repo
  - Enter ./run.sh /tutorials/synthesis/goldenHour.cpp
  - To play the song, press the "B" key
* In this piece, I was attempting to replicate one of my favorite songs, which is a beautifully intricate piece played on the keys. For some reason, I was unable to replicate the sound of a piano using any of the preset piano reccomendations, so I went rogue and attempted to produce a similar effect with that of a short and sharp plucked string instrument (similar to that of a koto). Overall, it works fairly well except many of the notes ring flat when they go past a certain range of frequencies. Additionally, I took the oppurtunity to build a graphical function that sends small "rectangle like" objects off like glitter each time a note is played, which provides a satisfying visual effect.  


###Piece Number Five: 
* Transcription
* "Mii Channel Theme" - Kazumi Totaka
* https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-MattReddick
* To play the piece:
  - Clone the repo
  - Enter ./run.sh /tutorials/synthesis/miichannel.cpp
* In this piece, I wanted to create a fun audio and visual experience with a transcription of the mii channel theme song. I took the same plucked string/koto sound from my previous project and combined it with a fun sub synth instrument to create a playful but fairly accurate replica of how the song was portrayed in my head. I modified the previous graphics from golden hour to both depict the new sub synth instrument (in a subtle yet pleasing way) along with adapting the visual star "semi-sphere" of notes that dance around the main components visually.
