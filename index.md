# Notes from Matt Reddick

CMPSC 190D, Digital Synthesis 


Piece Number One: 
* Transcription
* Intro inspired by  - (Fur by Endor) , rest of song inspired by - (Beethoven by Kenndog)
* https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-MattReddick
* To play the piece:
  - Clone the repo
  - Enter ./run.sh /tutorials/synthesis/beethovenRap.cpp
  - To play the song, press the "B" key
* In this song, I was attempting to combine two different songs that I enjoy very much personally, and integrate them into a small piece with beeats and instruments typical of that in a house song. All in all, while I was never fully happy with the sound profile I created for the beat, I got the chance to experiment with more immersive graphics. I took this piece as an oppurtunity to experiment with many overlayyed shapes, and created a graphical experience that is very intense and perhaps obnoxious. Enjoy!
